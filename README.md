## Goal

This repo's goal was to develop an appliction testing Whisper's capabilities for real-time voice transcription. Implementing [SpeechRecognizers](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition) made this possible by processing audio input per lingual pauses.

## Usage

1. Run the executable 'voicebridge'.
2. Select your *input* and *output* languages.
3. Generate `.mp3` files of translated speech.
4. Save and replay up to ==7 different recordings at a time==.

## Requirements

- OpenAI Whisper
- deep_translator
- speech_recognition
- gTTs
- tkinter

## Limitations

Voicebridge requires an internet connection due to Google API use.

- To implement offline functionality, look into [Argos Translate](https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate) and [pyttsx3](https://github.com/nateshmbhat/pyttsx3)
